# Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

This repository provides a Python-based implementation of a Hidden Markov Model created for studying probabilistic sequence modeling.

The work focuses on understanding hidden states, transition probabilities, emission probabilities, and sequence inference.

This repository is maintained for academic learning purposes.
